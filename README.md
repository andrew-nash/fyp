# Developing Principled Methodologies for CNN-Based Time Series Analysis, with a Practical Demonstration using Electrocardiogram Data

`novel_activations.py` contins the imlpementation of our novel activation function

`base_wavelet_model.py` contins the driver code for data input/output, experimental setup, and cross-validated of model training

`hypothesis_tests.py` contains the driver code for performing hypothesis tests between some of the cross-validated metrics generated during model fitting

`report_resnet_exp.py`, `wavelet_report_exps.py` and `report_simple_wevelet_exp.py` contain the configurations for some of the experiments in our paper

`empirical_experiments.py` contains the code which performed testing and evaluation on the experimental data.
